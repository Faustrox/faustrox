# üí´ About Me:
Hello,<br><br>My name is Fausto J√°quez and I am a mid-level full-stack developer. I started my programming journey in high school,<br>where I learned C++. After graduating, I continued my education at the Cincinnatus Institute, where I specialized<br>in software craftsmanship and learned HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript and the basics of being a Software Developer.<br>After completing the program, I was hired by Intellisys, the company that owns the institute, as a Developer.<br>I started working on backend development, but I also had experience working with frontend development as well.<br>I eventually transitioned to full-stack development.<br><br>This company was my first job as a Developer. I learned a great deal during my time here, and I am grateful for<br>the opportunity to have worked with such a talented team. Unfortunately, I was recently let go due to a company-wide<br>reduction in force. I am confident that I will be able to find a new position where I can continue to use my skills and<br>experience to make a positive impact.<br><br>üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on my own portfolio page!<br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on companies and freelance works.<br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with new works, open to contribute to the community.<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Next.JS and C#.<br>‚ö° I leverage AI in my daily work and I am committed to its continuous improvement.
